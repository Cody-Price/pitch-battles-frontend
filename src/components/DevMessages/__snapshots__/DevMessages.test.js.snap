    Now that Pitch Battles is beginning to see some traffic, we have had to rollback and migrate our database to accomodate a growing user population. If you previously created an account, you will need to create a new one. This should be the last time this happens pending some unforeseen catastrophe.

    Additionally, we have been adding loads of small improvements to the student-facing user interface including support for iOS browsers, but we are still looking for user feedback. If you find any bugs, please send us an email at teampitchbattles@gmail.com!
